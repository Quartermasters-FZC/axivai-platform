The AXIVAI mobile charging architecture is designed to treat **electricity as physical cargo**, allowing school districts to bypass traditional grid constraints and utility interconnection queues. This "Logistics-First" approach is divided into three distinct "lanes" based on the operational requirements of different bus clusters:

### 1. Lane 1: Direct Injection
*   **Asset Class:** Class 6 Electric Truck (carrying approximately **500 kWh**).
*   **Use Case:** This lane is optimised for **short runs and satellite depots**. 
*   **Economics:** The indicative cost for this service is approximately **$0.25/kWh**.

### 2. Lane 2: The Mothership
*   **Asset Class:** Class 8 Semi-Trailer (carrying approximately **2 MWh**).
*   **Use Case:** The "Mothership" is designed for **high-volume depot clusters**, where large numbers of buses are concentrated and require significant energy throughput. 
*   **Economics:** Like Lane 1, this high-capacity service has an indicative cost of roughly **$0.25/kWh**.

### 3. Lane 3: The Valet
*   **Asset Class:** Electric Van (carrying approximately **150 kWh**).
*   **Use Case:** This lane specifically addresses the **"Park-Out" infrastructure void**, where drivers take buses home overnight. These smaller, more agile vehicles can navigate **HOA-restricted areas and residential streets** to charge buses at drivers' residences, solving the housing equity gap for drivers who cannot install home charging infrastructure.
*   **Economics:** Due to the more complex, distributed nature of the delivery, the indicative cost is higher at approximately **$0.35/kWh**.

By utilizing these three lanes, AXIVAI can deploy charging infrastructure in **weeks rather than the 18 to 36 months** (or up to eight years in some regions) typically required for utility grid upgrades. This architecture ensures that even districts with "park-out" models or constrained local grids can maintain operational reliability.

**Analogy for Understanding:**
Think of the traditional grid as a **fixed network of water pipes**; if the pipes are too small, you cannot get enough water to your house without years of digging and construction. AXIVAI’s three-lane architecture is like a **fleet of water tankers**: Lane 2 is the massive tanker for the whole neighbourhood, Lane 1 is a standard delivery truck for a local business, and Lane 3 is a small van that can pull right into your driveway to fill your tank directly.
