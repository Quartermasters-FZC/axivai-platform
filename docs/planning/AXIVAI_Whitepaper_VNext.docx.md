# **1\. Executive Summary**

## **The Thesis**

| *America's multi-billion-dollar investment in electric school buses is at risk—not from technology failure, but from infrastructure gridlock. AXIVAI is the platform that separates fleet electrification from grid dependency.* |
| :---- |

## **The Situation**

The United States has committed over $5 billion through the EPA Clean School Bus Program (CSBP) to electrify the nation's fleet of approximately 480,000 school buses—the largest mass transit system in the country, transporting approximately 25 million children daily. Districts across the country have purchased electric buses, often using federal funding.

The reality is starkly different. Thousands of electric school buses sit idle in parking lots, unable to charge. The EPA Inspector General identified utility delays as a significant impediment to deployment. While manufacturers can build a bus in months, utility upgrades routinely take 18 to 36 months—and in some regions like PJM, the timeline from interconnection request to commercial operation now averages approximately eight years.

## **The Complication**

The market's structural fragility was exposed in 2024–2025 when Lion Electric, a leading manufacturer, filed for bankruptcy protection. In July 2025, Deloitte Restructuring notified U.S. customers that warranties for all purchases outside Quebec were voided, leaving school districts with multi-million-dollar stranded assets they cannot repair.

Simultaneously, the dominant service providers have failed to solve the fundamental infrastructure problem:

* Highland Electric Fleets has faced significant operational challenges. Montgomery County Public Schools' Inspector General documented 280 instances where buses were unable to complete routes.

* Nuvve Holding Corp has faced severe financial challenges including multiple reverse stock splits (cumulative 400:1 ratio) and NASDAQ compliance issues.

## **The Resolution**

AXIVAI inverts the traditional model. Rather than bringing buses to chargers connected to constrained grid infrastructure, AXIVAI brings chargers to buses wherever they are located. By treating electricity as physical cargo rather than a wire-based service, the platform bypasses interconnection queues entirely.

Key differentiators:

* Three-Lane Mobile Charging Architecture

* Certified Ecosystem (not hardware agnostic)

* V1G-First Strategy

* Transparent TCO Calculator

* Grant Facilitation Model

# **2\. The Crisis: America's Stranded Electric Bus Fleet**

The electrification of America's school bus fleet represents one of the most significant clean transportation initiatives in the nation's history. The approximately 480,000 diesel school buses currently in operation transport roughly 25 million children daily, making them the largest mass transit system in the country.

## **2.1 The Infrastructure Bottleneck**

| *The Core Problem: While a manufacturer can produce a bus in approximately six months, the utility upgrades required routinely take 18 to 36 months—and in some regions, significantly longer.* |
| :---- |

**Macro-Level: Grid and Utility Constraints**

| Challenge | Impact | Verification |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Grid Logjam | PJM timeline from interconnection request to commercial operation: \~8 years. Queue: \~268 GW as of late 2023\. | VERIFIED — Berkeley Lab 2024, RMI 2025 |
| Capacity Overload | 50+ bus depot requires megawatt-scale power—equivalent to adding a large factory to residential grids. | VERIFIED — Engineering standard |
| Equipment Shortages | Transformer lead times: 18–24+ months. | VERIFIED — DOE reports |
| Bureaucratic Friction | Early funding rounds did not mandate district-utility coordination. | VERIFIED — EPA OIG reports |

**Micro-Level: Site and Park-Out Challenges**

| Challenge | Impact |
| ----- | ----- |
| Residential Constraints | Level 2 chargers (19.2 kW) draw 80 amps continuously, requiring panel upgrades costing $2,000–$6,000 per home. |
| Civil Works at Depots | Trenching through concrete/asphalt, charger pedestals, and protective bollards reduce available space. |
| Reimbursement Complexity | Administrative burden calculating and reimbursing electricity costs on drivers' personal utility bills. |

## **2.2 The OEM Collapse & Stranded Asset Crisis**

The electric school bus market has experienced a wave of manufacturer failures that has fundamentally altered the risk calculus for school district procurement officers.

**The Lion Electric Collapse**

| Event | Consequence | Verification |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Bankruptcy Filing (Late 2024\) | Closure of Joliet facility; consolidation to Quebec. | VERIFIED — Court filings, news reports |
| Warranty Voided (July 2025\) | Deloitte notified U.S. customers warranties voided. \~2,000 buses affected. | VERIFIED — Deloitte letter July 15, 2025 |
| Safety Concerns (Sept 2025\) | Inspection bulletins following Montreal fire (heating wiring, not battery). | VERIFIED — WRI FAQ, news reports |

**District Fallout:**

* Herscher CUSD No. 2 (Illinois): 25 Lion buses with $9.875M EPA funding. Six buses required repairs with no manufacturer support.

* Yarmouth School District (Maine): Two Lion buses (\~$345K each) sat idle for 2024–2025 school year due to software errors.

**The Broader Pattern of Failure**

| Administrative Pause | January 2025 pause; partial resumption February 2025 following court orders | VERIFIED — Electric School Bus Initiative |

## **2.4 The Park-Out Infrastructure Void**

The park-out model—where drivers take buses home overnight—is a logistical pillar of rural and suburban school transportation. In the electric era, it is an infrastructure crisis:

* Panel Upgrades: 19.2 kW Level 2 chargers require 80-amp circuits; many older homes have only 100–200 amp service.

* Legal Complexity: NY Labor Law 240/241 liability, property damage indemnification, tenant/landlord conflicts.

* Housing Equity Gap: Many drivers do not own their homes and cannot install charging infrastructure.

# **3\. Why Current Approaches Fail**

The electric school bus market has attracted significant capital and entrepreneurial attention. However, the dominant business models have proven inadequate to address the systemic challenges.

## **3.1 Highland Electric Fleets: The Lock-In Model**

Highland Electric Fleets has emerged as the largest Electrification-as-a-Service provider. The Montgomery County Public Schools contract provides a documented case study:

| Issue | Documentation | Verification |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Delivery Delays | All buses from 2022–2024 delivered after required dates | VERIFIED — Montgomery County OIG Report, July 2024 |
| Route Completion Issues | 280 instances where buses unable to complete routes | VERIFIED — Montgomery County OIG Report |

| Stockholders' Equity | Failed $2.5M minimum requirement | VERIFIED — NASDAQ notice, August 2025 |

| *Note: Nuvve has continued to operate and announced new contracts through 2025\. Long-term viability remains subject to market conditions.* |
| :---- |

## **3.3 The Transparency Gap**

A fundamental gap in the market: no dominant player offers districts a transparent, planning-grade TCO calculator.

| Capability | Typical Vendor Tools | AXIVAI |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| TCO Calculator | Marketing-grade | Planning-grade |
| Data Provenance | Assumptions hidden | Sources cited |
| Sensitivity Analysis | Limited or none | Comprehensive |
| Assumption Override | Not available | User-configurable |
| Scenario Comparison | Pre-selected favorable | Multi-scenario including unfavorable |

# **4\. The AXIVAI Platform Architecture**

| *The Core Insight: Separate fleet electrification from grid dependency. Treat electricity as physical cargo, not a wire-based service.* |
| :---- |

## **4.1 Core Philosophy: Electricity as Physical Cargo**

AXIVAI inverts the traditional model. Rather than bringing buses to chargers connected to constrained grid infrastructure, the platform brings chargers to buses wherever they are located—at depots, satellite lots, or driver residences.

Analogy: Imagine a city facing a severe water shortage because underground pipes are too small and taking years to replace. Instead of waiting for the city to dig up every street (Construction-First), AXIVAI acts like a fleet of high-capacity water tankers delivering water directly (Logistics-First).

## **4.2 The Three-Lane Mobile Charging Architecture**

Not all charging scenarios are equal. AXIVAI maps each fleet's operational requirements and assigns the most efficient delivery asset to each bus cluster.

| Lane | Asset Class | Use Case | Indicative Cost\* |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1: Direct Injection | Class 6 Electric Truck (\~500 kWh) | Short runs, satellite depots | \~$0.25/kWh |
| 2: Mothership | Class 8 Semi-Trailer (\~2 MWh) | Depot clusters, high volume | \~$0.25/kWh |
| 3: Valet | Electric Van (\~150 kWh) | HOA-restricted, driver homes | \~$0.35/kWh |

*\*Indicative costs subject to validation. See Appendix B.*

**Power Sourcing Strategy**

| Power Source | Indicative Cost ($/kWh) | Availability |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Landfill Gas-to-Energy | $0.03–0.04 | 24/7 baseload |
| Solar \+ Storage | $0.04–0.06 | Daytime \+ stored |
| Wind \+ Storage | $0.03–0.05 | Variable \+ stored |
| Off-Peak Grid | $0.06–0.08 | Night hours |

*Note: Power costs are indicative and subject to PPA negotiations.*

## **4.3 The Certified Ecosystem Approach**

The platform adopts a "Certified Ecosystem" approach addressing the hardware-software finger-pointing that has plagued deployments.

* Firmware-level integration testing with each hardware partner

* Single warranty responsibility chain

* OTA update compatibility verification

* Cold weather performance validation

* Interoperability testing with major bus OEMs (Blue Bird, Thomas Built, IC Bus)

## **4.4 V1G-First Strategy**

While competitors chase V2G revenue with immature hardware, AXIVAI leads with V1G (smart charging) which captures significant economic value at lower cost and complexity.

| Capability | V1G (Smart Charging) | V2G (Bidirectional) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Hardware Cost | Standard chargers ($5–15K) | Bidirectional inverters ($40–60K+) |
| Regulatory Status | Fully approved | Certification challenges |
| Warranty Impact | Standard coverage | Potential OEM concerns |
| Value Capture | Demand charge avoidance, off-peak rates | Grid services (when frameworks mature) |

## **4.5 Integrated Capabilities**

* Licensed Insurance Services: Telematics-informed coverage for 15–25% fleet cost reduction

* Carbon Credit Monetization: $150–$500 per vehicle annually through LCFS and voluntary markets\*

* VPP/Energy Services: $450–$1,850 per vehicle annually through demand response\*

* Grant Facilitation Model: Pro bono or success-fee application support; districts own assets

*\*Subject to market conditions and program availability.*

# **5\. TCO Calculator Architecture**

| *The Opportunity: The market lacks a transparent, planning-grade TCO calculator. AXIVAI fills this gap with a tool that shows assumptions, cites sources, and acknowledges uncertainty.* |
| :---- |

## **5.1 Design Philosophy**

* Transparency: Every assumption is visible. Every data source is cited. Every formula is explainable.

* Honesty About Uncertainty: Distinguishes known values, estimated values, and unknown values requiring user input.

* Scenario Comparison: Districts can compare multiple scenarios including unfavorable ones.

## **5.2 Modular Architecture**

Five-Layer Design:

* Layer 1: User Inputs Module (fleet profile, operational profile, location, current costs, planning horizon)

* Layer 2: Authoritative Defaults Module (EIA electricity/diesel, OEM pricing, NREL maintenance data)

* Layer 3: Computation Engine (standardized formulas for each cost category)

* Layer 4: Scenario Comparison Engine (parallel analyses across Diesel, Self-Managed, EaaS, AXIVAI)

* Layer 5: Output & Visualization (results with provenance chains and uncertainty ranges)

## **5.3 Cost Modules with Formulas**

**Module 1: Capital Costs**

CapEx\_Bus \= (Bus\_Price × Fleet\_Size) \- Grant\_Amount

*Bus prices by type: Type A ($280K–$350K), Type C ($375K–$420K), Type D ($420K–$480K). Prices are indicative.*

**Module 2: Energy Costs**

Energy\_Cost \= (kWh\_Consumed × Rate) \+ Demand\_Charges

kWh\_Consumed \= Fleet\_Size × Annual\_Miles × kWh\_per\_Mile × (1 \+ Weather\_Factor)

**Module 3: Maintenance Costs**

Maint\_EV \= Fleet\_Size × Per\_Mile\_Cost × Annual\_Miles × (1 \+ Age\_Factor)

*Industry data: EV \~$0.15–0.25/mile; Diesel \~$0.35–0.50/mile.*

## **5.4 Data Provenance Strategy**

| Priority | Data Source | Update Frequency |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1: Energy Data | EIA Electricity Data, EIA Diesel Prices, OpenEI Utility Rates | Monthly/Weekly/Quarterly |
| 2: Vehicle/Equipment | OEM Pricing, Charger Pricing | Quarterly/Semi-annual |
| 3: Incentives/Grants | EPA CSBP, DSIRE Database, State DOT Programs | As announced/Monthly/Quarterly |

# **6\. Governance, Safety, and Compliance**

## **6.1 Human-in-the-Loop Principles**

AXIVAI provides decision support, not automated decision-making. All significant outputs are designed to inform human judgment, not replace it. District officials retain accountability to their communities.

## **6.2 Guardrails and Accountability**

* Confidence Indicators: Outputs include scores reflecting data quality and methodological uncertainty

* Assumption Warnings: Users receive notifications when defaults significantly affect outcomes

* Scope Limitations: The system acknowledges when questions are outside its knowledge domain

## **6.3 Data Privacy**

* Data Minimization: Only information necessary for analytical value

* User Control: Districts can export or delete data

* No Third-Party Sales: District data is never sold

## **6.4 AI Governance**

For AI-powered components:

* Knowledge Grounding: Responses generated from verified knowledge base

* Citation Requirements: All factual claims cite sources

* Quality Gates: Validation processes prevent unverified claims

* Feedback Integration: User corrections incorporated into knowledge base
